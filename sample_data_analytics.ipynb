    "# Data Analysis Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Data Analysis? Simply put, analysing data to draw conclusions. Generally this involves two phases: preparing the data, and analysing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin to analyze data, you need to make sure that the data is ready to be analyzed. This involves things like:\n",
    "1. Data Collection (typically at Scorpion the data collection is done automatically by various services)\n",
    "2. Data Quality control - make sure the data was collected, reported, and stored in a way that doesn't have any inherent biases or errors.\n",
    "3. Data Cleaning - often there will be missing data, or data you know is less reliable\n",
    "4. Data Prep - often the data needs to be transformed or aggregated before analysis can begin\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the process of taking reliable data and trying to get business insights out of it. Here are the 4 main types of analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive Analysis: Descriptive data analysis looks at past data and tells what happened. This is often used when tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), revenue, sales leads, and more.\n",
    "2. Diagnostic Analysis: Diagnostic data analysis aims to determine why something happened. Once your descriptive analysis shows that something negative or positive happened, diagnostic analysis can be done to figure out the reason. A business may see that leads increased in the month of October and use diagnostic analysis to determine which marketing efforts contributed the most.\n",
    "3. Predictive Analysis: Predictive data analysis predicts what is likely to happen in the future. In this type of research, trends are derived from past data which are then used to form predictions about the future. For example, to predict next yearâ€™s revenue, data from previous years will be analyzed. If revenue has gone up 20% every year for many years, we would predict that revenue next year will be 20% higher than this year. This is a simple example, but predictive analysis can be applied to much more complicated issues such as risk assessment, sales forecasting, or qualifying leads.\n",
    "4. Prescriptive Analysis: Prescriptive data analysis combines the information found from the previous 3 types of data analysis and forms a plan of action for the organization to face the issue or decision. This is where the data-driven choices are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Demo\n",
    "For this demo, I've selected a pretty famous and well studied dataset, the Ames Housing Dataset. Here's a link to a Kaggle page where you can download the data for yourself:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll go over the basics of importing your data, summarising your data, basic cleaning, looking for insights and trends, and visualization. Of course, there's much more, but this should give a basic idea of what a day in the life of a data analyist might look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "I downloaded the data from that website, and unzipped it all into my \"data/\" folder. Now I'm ready to begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I need to import the various libraries (or modules) that I'll be using. In Python, it's easy to import any library that you've already installed with pip or conda. In this case, I've installed these libraries (and many more) into a Conda Virtual Environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, I'm importing \"as\", which just means I'm renaming them for my own purposes. That way, I can just write \"pd\" instead of writing \"pandas\" all the time. These are standard conventions for these libraries."
